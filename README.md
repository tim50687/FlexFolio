Description

Flexfolio is designed to be a platform and portfolio for having fun working out and exercising with friends while tracking a personalized fitness journey. The platform will foster fun and motivation around sharing fitness progress.
The database will store information on each user and the workouts they create. Users are required to login with a unique email and password and are then assigned a unique ID number and registration date. 
To enhance their profile, users may upload a headshot, recorded with a unique URL and upload date. Each user is then given the option to create and/or join any number of interest-based groups focused on roommates, family, or workout buddies. 
Each group is given a unique ID, group photo and is defined by name, description, date created and is also given a unique group passcode used to invite users to join, facilitating community-building around shared interests.
After each user joins a group, they can make many posts about fitness achievements with images and captions. Each post is open to many likes and comments from other users, fostering interaction and motivation. 
Each comment is associated with the user who authored it and is related to the post. Each like given to a post is attributed to the user who admired the post and the post itself. 
Users can only make posts within their joined groups, making them visible to all members of those groups. To promote camaraderie and healthy competition, the platform allows users to log their workouts with detailed exercise information, including sets, repetitions, and the workout's date.
