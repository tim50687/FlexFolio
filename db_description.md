Each user has a unique ID, along with personal details like name, email, and registration date. The platform also provides the ability for users to join specific groups. For example, they can create a group for their roomate, or even family. related to their interests, and every group in the database is defined by its unique name and description.

Every user can share fitness-related posts, which may contain images, textual descriptions, and can be liked or commented upon by other users.

This idea interests us due to how we both enjoy going to the gym and getting exercise. Creating an application such as this allows us to create an environment for people who share the same mindset to share fitness plans and progress updates, thus creating a tight knit community within groups. There are a variety of ways to organize workouts with different goals in mind. This gave way to the idea of creating an application that organizes this while also bolstering the social aspect of going to the gym. The idea of making a social media application is particularly interesting to us given its use of relationships revolving around each user and their interaction with other entities within the application. The topic of centering the application around workouts permits us to administrate what we find to be engaging data.
