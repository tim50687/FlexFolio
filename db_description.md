The database is the foundation of a dynamic social fitness platform, empowering users to share their fitness journeys, engage with fellow enthusiasts, and meticulously track their workout progress. Each user is required to give an email and password to login. They are then assigned a unique ID and can personalize their profile with essential details like their name, and registration date. Additionally, each user has the option to join one to many interest-based groups, whether they are focused on roommates, family, or workout buddies. Each group also has an unique ID, and is defined by a name, description, date created and also the group passcode that can be used to invite other users, facilitating community-building around shared interests.

After each user participates in a group, they can make many posts about their fitness achievements, enhancing their posts with images and captions. Each one of these posts are open to many likes and comments from other users, fostering interaction and motivation. To encourage interaction and support within groups, users can comment on posts, with each comment associated with the user who authored it and the related post. Users can further express their appreciation for posts by liking them, with each like attributed to the user who admired the post and the post itself. 

Users can only make the posts within specific groups, making them visible to all members of those groups. To promote camaraderie and healthy competition, the platform allows users to log their workouts with detailed exercise information, including sets, repetitions, and the workout's date.

Enhancing user profiles, members can upload a headshot, recorded with a unique URL and upload date. Lastly, users can also monitor the workout progress of fellow group members, fostering a sense of community and encouragement within the same group.

introduction

This idea interests us due to how we both enjoy going to the gym and getting exercise. Creating an application such as this allows us to create an environment for people who share the same mindset to share fitness plans and progress updates, thus creating a tight knit community within groups. There are a variety of ways to organize workouts with different goals in mind. This gave way to the idea of creating an application that organizes this while also bolstering the social aspect of going to the gym. The idea of making a social media application is particularly interesting to us given its use of relationships revolving around each user and their interaction with other entities within the application. The topic of centering the application around workouts permits us to administrate what we find to be engaging data.
